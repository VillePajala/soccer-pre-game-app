## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Then fill in your Supabase project details:
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and feature
    flags such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE`.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

   When launched, a **Start Screen** appears with options to start a new game, load an existing one, create a season or tournament, or view statistics. Select an action to continue to the main field view.

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file using `.env.example` as a template. The key variables are:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key
# Enable Supabase storage
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true
# Optional fallback behavior
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK=false
# Server-side service key (optional)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

These values configure Supabase access and feature flags.

## Important Notes

*   **Data Storage:** By default all data is kept in your browser's `localStorage`. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true`, your data will be synced to your Supabase project instead. Either way, continue using the **Full Backup** feature to safeguard your records.
*   **Deprecation Notice:** localStorage support will be removed in a future release. Please migrate your data to Supabase.
*   **Offline Use:** To get the best experience, install the app on your device when prompted by your browser ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, or an install icon in the address bar on desktop).
