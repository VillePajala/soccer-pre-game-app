## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VillePajala/soccer-pre-game-app.git
    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

   When launched, a **Start Screen** appears with options to start a new game, load an existing one, create a season or tournament, or view statistics. Select an action to continue to the main field view.

## Supabase Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials.
2. Enable Supabase by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE=true` in `.env.local`.
3. Run the migration script from the Settings modal to import your existing data.

See [docs/migration-troubleshooting.md](docs/migration-troubleshooting.md) for common issues.
### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE` â€” set to `true` to switch the app to Supabase.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FALLBACK` â€” if `true`, the app will not fall back to localStorage.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` â€” your Supabase project URL.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` â€” the anonymous API key.

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Important Notes

*   **Data Storage:** All your data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. This is fast and enables offline use, but it means clearing your browser data will erase everything. **Use the "Full Backup" feature regularly!**
*   **Offline Use:** To get the best experience, install the app on your device when prompted by your browser ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, or an install icon in the address bar on desktop).
