    cd soccer-pre-game-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start using the app.

## Running Tests

Install project dependencies with `npm install` as shown above. Then execute the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:unit
```

The tests rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Important Notes

*   **Data Storage:** All your data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. This is fast and enables offline use, but it means clearing your browser data will erase everything. **Use the "Full Backup" feature regularly!**
*   **Offline Use:** To get the best experience, install the app on your device when prompted by your browser ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile, or an install icon in the address bar on desktop).
