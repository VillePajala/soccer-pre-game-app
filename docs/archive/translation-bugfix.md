# Translation System Bugfix

## Issue
The "Load Game" modal had translation issues where certain UI elements were not being translated when switching to Finnish:
- Filter buttons ("All", "Season", "Tournament") showed as raw translation keys
- Filter input placeholder text was not translated
- Load Game button text was not translated
- No results message was not translated
- Date format appears in English format (e.g., "Apr 20, 2025") instead of Finnish format (should be "20.4.2025")

## Root Cause
The application uses a hybrid translation system that combines:
1. JSON files in `src/locales/` for some translations
2. Programmatically defined translations in `src/i18n.ts`

The missing translations were not properly defined in either location. Most components in the app use namespaced keys like `loadGameModal.keyName`, but the code was trying to access these with various fallback patterns that weren't consistent with how the translation system was configured.

For date formatting, the application likely uses a date formatting library but isn't connecting the current language setting to the date display format.

## Solution
We added the missing translations directly to the `src/i18n.ts` file, following the existing pattern of programmatically defining translations there:

1. Added the missing translation keys to the appropriate namespaces:
```javascript
// Add load game modal translations if section doesn't exist
if (!fiTranslations.loadGameModal) {
  fiTranslations.loadGameModal = {};
}

// Add the filter translations for Finnish
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.filter_all = "Kaikki";
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.filter_season = "Sarja";
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.filter_tournament = "Turnaus";
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.filterPlaceholder = "Suodata nimellä/päivämäärällä...";
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.loadButton = "Lataa Peli";
fiTranslations.loadGameModal.noFilterResults = "Ei hakutuloksia.";

// English translations similarly added
```

2. Updated the component code to use the correct namespaced translation keys:
```javascript
// From:
return t(`filter_${type}`);

// To:
return t(`loadGameModal.filter_${type}`, type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + type.slice(1));
```

3. For fixing the date format issue, we need to:
   - Check where dates are formatted in the application
   - Ensure the date formatting respects the current language setting
   - For Finnish (fi), use the format "DD.MM.YYYY" (e.g., "20.4.2025") 
   - If using a library like date-fns or Intl, make sure the locale matches the app's current language

Example implementation:
```javascript
// Using date-fns with locale
import { format } from 'date-fns';
import { fi, enUS } from 'date-fns/locale';

// Get current language
const currentLanguage = i18n.language;
const locale = currentLanguage === 'fi' ? fi : enUS;

// Format date according to locale
const formattedDate = format(
  new Date(date),
  currentLanguage === 'fi' ? 'd.M.yyyy' : 'MMM d, yyyy',
  { locale }
);
```

## Lessons & Best Practices
1. **Consistent Namespacing**: Always use the correct namespace prefix for translation keys (e.g., `loadGameModal.keyName`).
2. **Provide Fallbacks**: When using `t()`, provide a default value as the second parameter to handle missing translations.
3. **Check Existing Patterns**: Look at how translations are handled in other parts of the app before adding new ones.
4. **Translation Source**: In this app, new translations should be added directly to `src/i18n.ts` rather than the JSON files.
5. **Testing**: Always test translations by switching languages to verify they appear correctly.
6. **Date Formatting**: Ensure dates are formatted according to locale conventions - Finnish dates typically use the format "DD.MM.YYYY" with periods as separators.

## Similar Issues
If you encounter similar translation issues in the future:
1. Check if the translation keys exist in `src/i18n.ts`
2. Verify the component is using the correct namespace prefix
3. Add missing translations following the pattern in `src/i18n.ts`
4. Match the translation structure between Finnish and English versions
5. For date/time formatting, ensure the format matches the conventions of the selected language
