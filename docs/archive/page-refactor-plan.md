# Refactoring Plan – Splitting `page.tsx`

> **Goal:** Reduce the current 3 500-line `src/app/page.tsx` file into a set of focused, well-tested modules/components so that the page component only orchestrates high-level UI composition.  We will approach this incrementally so the application stays shippable after every step.

---

## 0. Preparation & Safety Net – ✅ Completed

1. **Baseline green CI** – run the full Jest suite (`npm test -- --watchAll=false`) and make sure everything is already passing. the correct test eun command can be checked from package.json
2. **Branching strategy** – create a long-lived feature branch `refactor/page-split` so we can merge small PRs for each step below.
3. **Snapshot tests** – add a Jest snapshot of the current `Home` page render (shallow render with `render(<Home />)`) so we can detect unintended structural changes while refactoring.
4. **Type-check gate** – ensure `npm run type-check` (tsc --noEmit) is part of CI so that type migrations caused by file moves are caught early.

### Manual testing
- Run `npm test` and confirm all suites pass.
- Execute `npm run type-check` to ensure there are no TypeScript errors.
- Start the dev server and verify the Home page loads without console errors.

---

## 1. Extract Fundamental **Types & Constants** – ✅ Completed
*(easy – no runtime behaviour change)*

**Tasks**
- Move all interfaces currently declared in `page.tsx` (`Point`, `Opponent`, `GameEvent`, `IntervalLog`, `AppState`, `TacticalDisc`, `SavedGamesCollection`, `TimerState`) to **`src/types/game.ts`**.
- Export them from an index barrel (`src/types/index.ts`) so imports stay short.
- Move the file-local constants `SEASONS_LIST_KEY`, `TIMER_STATE_KEY`, etc. that are not already in `src/config` into **`src/config/storageKeys.ts`**.
- Adjust imports in `page.tsx` (and anywhere else).

**Unit tests**
- TS-only change → run `npm run type-check`; add a dedicated jest test that imports every new type & constant just to assert the module resolves (guards against circular import regressions).
### Manual testing
- Start the dev server and confirm the home page renders without runtime errors.
- Save a new game and reload the page to verify storage keys still work.
- Run `npm run type-check` to catch any missing type or constant exports.

## 2. Create `useGameDataQueries` Hook – ✅ Completed
*(isolates TanStack Query logic)*

**Tasks**
1. New file `src/hooks/useGameDataQueries.ts` that wraps the five separate `useQuery` calls for roster, seasons, tournaments, saved games, and current game id.
2. The hook returns a typed object `{ masterRoster, seasons, tournaments, savedGames, currentGameId, loading, error }`.
3. Replace the five individual `useQuery` invocations in `page.tsx` with this single hook call.

**Unit tests**
- Mock `@tanstack/react-query` and the underlying utility fns. Test that the hook returns aggregated data and `loading` flag logic works (truthy when **any** query is loading).
### Manual testing
- Launch the app and ensure roster, seasons, tournaments and saved games data all display.
- Toggle offline mode and reload to verify an error message appears.
- Observe that a loading indicator is shown during initial data fetch.

---

## 3. Extract **Undo / Redo History** Logic – ✅ Completed
*(currently ~120 lines)*

**Tasks**
1. Create `src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts` implementing the current history array & index handling.
2. Provide API `{ state, set(next), undo(), redo(), canUndo, canRedo }`.
3. Replace the trio `[history, setHistory, historyIndex]` in `page.tsx` with the new hook.

**Unit tests**
- Feed the hook with a dummy `initialState` object; assert push, undo, and redo mutate `state` correctly and `canUndo/Redo` flags update.
### Manual testing
- Make a change (e.g., move a player) then click Undo to confirm the previous state returns.
- After an undo, click Redo and verify the state reapplies.
- Attempt to undo past the first change and check that the Undo control disables or has no effect.

---

## 4. Extract **Timer & Visibility / Wake-lock** – ✅ Completed
*(largest isolated behaviour)*

**Tasks**
1. New hook `src/hooks/useGameTimer.ts` that owns:
   • `timeElapsedInSeconds`, `isTimerRunning`, `nextSubDueTimeSeconds`, `subAlertLevel`, `lastSubConfirmationTimeSeconds`  
   • side-effects: visibility listener, auto-save of timer state, wake-lock sync.
2. Provide API currently needed by the component: `startPause()`, `reset()`, `ackSubstitution()`, etc.
3. Remove the duplicated `handleVisibilityChange` inner functions in `page.tsx` – they move to the hook.

**Unit tests**
- Use Jest fake timers to test that `timeElapsedInSeconds` increments only while running.
- Simulate page visibility change events to ensure timer pauses/stores state.

### Manual testing
- Start the app and verify the timer counts up when Start is pressed and pauses when paused.
- Hide the browser tab and return to confirm the timer resumes and accounts for time away.
- Trigger a substitution to ensure the next due time updates and alert level resets.

---

## 5. Extract **Tactical Board** State & Handlers – ✅ Completed

**Tasks**
- New hook `src/hooks/useTacticalBoard.ts` managing `isTacticsBoardView`, `tacticalDiscs`, `tacticalDrawings`, `tacticalBallPosition` and related handlers (`handleAddTacticalDisc`, `handleTacticalDiscMove`, …).
- Move formation-placement helper inside (currently inside `handlePlaceAllPlayers`).
- Expose API used by `SoccerField` & `ControlBar`.

**Unit tests**
- Add/Remove disc updates array immutably.
- Toggling disc type cycles through home→opponent→goalie.

### Manual testing
- Toggle the tactics board view and ensure discs and drawings appear only in that mode.
- Add, move and remove tactical discs to verify state persists.
- Drag the ball to new positions and confirm location is stored.
- Draw on the board and clear drawings using the control bar.
- Use "Reset Field" while in tactics mode to clear only tactical elements.

---

## 6. Extract **Roster Management** into Dedicated Hook – ✅ Completed

**Tasks**
- New hook `src/hooks/useRoster.ts` encapsulating `availablePlayers`, mutations (`addPlayer`, `updatePlayer`, `removePlayer`, `setGoalieStatus`) and the highlight/prompt UI flags.
- Provide memoised selectors (`playersForCurrentGame`) and callbacks for bar/roster modal.

**Unit tests**
- Mock `masterRosterManager` utilities and verify optimistic updates roll back on error.

### Manual testing
- Open the roster modal and confirm players can be added, edited and removed.
- Toggle goalie status from the roster modal and verify only one goalie persists.
- Start a new game and ensure the roster button highlights as expected.
- Reload a saved game and verify player selections load correctly.
- Refresh the page after making roster changes to confirm persistence.

---

## 7. Move **Export / Import** Helpers to Utility File – ✅ Completed

**Tasks**
- Create `src/utils/exportGames.ts` with `exportJson(game)`, `exportCsv(game)`, `exportAggregateJson(allGames)` & `exportAggregateCsv(allGames)`.
- Delete inline functions `handleExportOneJson`, `handleExportOneCsv`, etc. from `page.tsx` and call utility instead.

**Unit tests**
- Given a minimal `AppState`, verify JSON stringifies correctly and CSV contains header row & formatted times.

### Manual testing
- Export a single saved game as JSON and verify the downloaded file opens and contains the expected data.
- Export a single saved game as CSV and confirm the header row and time values are formatted correctly.
- Use the aggregate export options in Game Stats to download JSON and CSV for multiple games and check the files include all selected games.
- Trigger each export button and ensure no errors appear in the browser console.

---

## 8. Introduce **Modal Visibility Context** – ✅ Completed
*(optional but reduces prop-drilling)*

**Tasks**
- Create context provider in `src/contexts/ModalProvider.tsx` that keeps all `isXModalOpen` booleans & their setters.
- Wrap `<Home>` content with the provider; inside, replace the multiple `useState` booleans with context values.

**Unit tests**
- Mount a test component inside the provider, toggle a modal and assert context value updates.

### Manual testing
- Launch the app and open each modal from the control bar to verify it appears and closes correctly.
- Open different modals in succession to ensure they do not interfere with each other's visibility.
- Refresh the page and confirm all modals are closed on initial load.
- Perform common actions like saving or loading a game to ensure the related modal still functions.

---

## 9. Collapse **Derived Data & Selectors** – ✅ Completed

**Tasks**
- Identify all `useMemo` inside `page.tsx` that compute derived lists (e.g. `playersForCurrentGame`). Move each to the most relevant hook (`useRoster`, `useGameTimer`, etc.).
- Ensure that memoisation dependencies match the new hook states.

**Unit tests**
- Unit-test selector correctness given mock inputs.

---

## 10. Final **Home Page Slim-down**

At this point `page.tsx` should mostly be:
```tsx
const { stateSlices, callbacks } = use…();
return (
  <main> …high-level layout… </main>
);
```
Remove obsolete code and make sure the line-count drops below ~300 lines.

**Unit tests**
- Update the initial snapshot test from step 0 – it should still match (except for expected prop changes).
- Run full e2e smoke test: render Home, simulate placing a player, saving a game, and opening GoalLog – no runtime errors.

### Manual testing
- Launch the dev server and verify the Home page loads without errors.
- Drag a player from the roster onto the field and confirm the disk appears.
- Save a game and reload the page to ensure it persists.
- Open and close each modal from the control bar to confirm they still work.
- Start the timer and make sure the overlay toggles correctly.
