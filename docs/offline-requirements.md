# Offline Requirements Analysis

## Current PWA Status
- ✅ PWA Manifest configured (fullscreen mode)
- ✅ Service Worker registered
- ⚠️ Basic service worker (no caching)
- ✅ localStorage data persistence

## Critical Offline Features Required

### 1. Core Game Functionality (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Game Timer**: Must work offline during active games
- **Player Positioning**: Drag-and-drop on soccer field
- **Score Tracking**: Goal/event logging
- **Player Substitutions**: Must work during games
- **Notes & Assessments**: Player evaluation forms

### 2. Data Access (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Player Roster**: View and manage players
- **Saved Games**: Access previous game data
- **Game Settings**: Tournament/season selection
- **App Settings**: User preferences

### 3. Data Persistence (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Game Saves**: Auto-save during games
- **Draft States**: Temporary game setups
- **User Preferences**: Settings persistence

### 4. Sync Functionality (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Background Sync**: Upload when connection restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle sync conflicts
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed uploads

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: IndexedDB Caching Layer
1. **Install IndexedDB library** (`idb-keyval` or `dexie`)
2. **Create offline cache manager** for storage abstraction
3. **Implement cache-first strategy** for critical data
4. **Add background sync** for data uploads

### Phase 2: Enhanced Service Worker
1. **Cache static assets** (app shell caching)
2. **Cache API responses** for critical endpoints
3. **Implement offline fallbacks** for network requests
4. **Add background sync** for data persistence

### Phase 3: User Experience
1. **Offline indicators** in UI
2. **Sync status notifications** 
3. **Conflict resolution UI**
4. **Manual sync controls**

## Data Flow Strategy

### Online Mode (Authenticated Users)
```
App ↔ StorageManager ↔ SupabaseProvider ↔ Supabase
                    ↕
                IndexedDB Cache
```

### Offline Mode
```
App ↔ StorageManager ↔ IndexedDB Cache ↔ Background Sync Queue
```

### Fallback Mode (Unauthenticated)
```
App ↔ StorageManager ↔ LocalStorageProvider ↔ localStorage
```
