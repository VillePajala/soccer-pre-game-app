# How to Add Players to Your Roster

Based on our analysis, the core issue is that your roster is empty. To fix this, you need to add players to your "Master Roster". Here's how:

**1. Open the Roster Management Screen:**
   - In the application, find and click the "Manage Roster" button. This will open the Roster Settings modal.

**2. Add Players to Your Roster:**
   - Once the modal is open, you'll see an "Add Player" button. Click it to open the new player form.
   - Fill in the player's name and any other details you want to record, such as jersey number and notes.
   - Click the "Add Player" button in the form to save the new player to your roster.
   - Repeat this process for all the players you want to add.

**3. (Optional) Select Players for the Current Game:**
   - After adding players to your master roster, you can select which players are available for the current game by checking the box next to their names.

Once you've added players to your roster, the application will be able to correctly associate game events with those players, and your statistics will start to populate as expected.
