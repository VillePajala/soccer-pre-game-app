# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Next.js)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes manifest generation)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run all Jest tests (executes `jest`)
- `npm run test:unit` - Alias for `npm test`

### Build Process
The build process includes a custom manifest generation step that runs before Next.js build:
- `node scripts/generate-manifest.mjs` - Generates PWA manifest based on branch
- Manifest configuration varies by branch (master vs development) for different app names and themes

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- **PWA** with custom service worker
- **Browser localStorage** for data persistence
- **React Query** for state management
- **i18next** for internationalization (English/Finnish)

### Core Architecture

**Data Flow**: The app's data layer relies on **React Query** to fetch, cache, and manage server-side state (persisted in localStorage). Asynchronous wrappers in `src/utils/localStorage.ts` are used for direct localStorage access. This approach centralizes data fetching and reduces manual state management.

**PWA Structure**: The app is a full PWA with:
- Custom service worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Dynamic manifest generation based on git branch
- Install prompts and update notifications

**State Management**: 
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: Acts as the central orchestrator, bringing together different state management strategies.
- **`useReducer` (`useGameSessionReducer.ts`)**: Manages the core game session state, including score, timer, periods, and game metadata. This provides predictable state transitions.
- **`useGameState` hook**: Manages the interactive state of the soccer field, including player positions on the field and drawings.
- **React Query**: Handles all asynchronous data operations, such as fetching and updating the master roster, seasons, tournaments, and saved games.
- **`useState`**: Used for managing local UI state within components (e.g., modal visibility).

**Key Components**:
- `SoccerField` - Interactive drag-and-drop field
- `PlayerBar` - Player roster management
- `ControlBar` - Main app controls
- Various modals for game settings, stats, and management

**Data Persistence**: All data is stored in browser localStorage with async wrappers in `src/utils/localStorage.ts`. Key data includes:
- Player roster (`src/utils/masterRosterManager.ts`)
- Game saves (`src/utils/savedGames.ts`)
- Seasons and tournaments (`src/utils/seasons.ts`, `src/utils/tournaments.ts`)
- App settings (`src/utils/appSettings.ts`)

**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library, configured for Next.js with custom setup in `jest.config.js`

## Key Files to Understand

- `src/app/page.tsx` - The main component that orchestrates the entire application, integrating hooks, reducers, and data fetching.
- `src/hooks/useGameSessionReducer.ts` - The reducer managing core game logic (timer, score, status). Crucial for understanding state transitions.
- `src/hooks/useGameState.ts` - The hook for managing interactive state on the soccer field (player positions, drawings).
- `src/utils/masterRosterManager.ts` - Handles all CRUD operations for the master player list, interacting with localStorage.
- `src/config/queryKeys.ts` - Defines the keys used for caching and invalidating data with React Query.
- `src/types/index.ts` - Core TypeScript interfaces (Player, Season, Tournament, AppState).
- `src/utils/localStorage.ts` - Async localStorage wrapper utilities.

## Development Notes

### Data Storage
All data is stored in browser localStorage. The app includes backup/restore functionality through `src/utils/fullBackup.ts`.

### Internationalization
The app supports English and Finnish with i18next. Translation files are in `src/locales/` and `public/locales/`.

### PWA Features
The app includes install prompts, update notifications, and works offline. The service worker is updated during build to trigger cache updates.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and components
- Test files are co-located with source files (`.test.tsx` suffix)
- Jest configuration excludes Playwright specs in `/tests/` directory
